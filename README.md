## About
This repository contains the Python 3.5 scripts used in Saboya et al. (2022), Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, ``Continuous CH4 and d13CH4 measurements in London demonstrate under-reported natural gas leakage'', which also forms a chapter of my PhD thesis. 

### Data
A substantial amount of in situ measurement and simulation data are used. Measurement and simulation data are available in the Zenodo repository: Graven, Heather, Zazzeri, Giulia, & Saboya, Eric. (2022). Graven Laboratory: Atmospheric methane measurements and simulations [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6044538 

Additional data (e.g. NAME back-trajectories) can be provided upon request.

### Python requirements
