# london_CH4_2022

## Welcome!
Thanks for dropping by! In this repository I've collated the Python 3 scripts used in Saboya et al. (2022), Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.
These scripts are also used in my PhD thesis. 

## About
In Saboya et al. (2022), atmospheric measurements of methane (CH4) and d13CH4 made from Imperial College London are used to evaluate sources of methane emissions in London from 2018-2020. Atmospheric measurements were compared with inventory reported CH4 emissions by combining emissions inventory estimates (from EDGAR and UK NAEI) with an atmospheric transport model (NAME). For more details, please read the published paper!

Scripts are organised based on whether they relate to atmospheric measurements, atmospheric simulations, or their comparison. I do not include the atmospheric data used. These can be found in the supplement of Saboya et al. (2022). 

Please feel free to use any of these scripts in accordance with the MIT license and citing Saboya et al. (2022) if used.
