## About
This repository contains the Python3 scripts used for the third chapter of my PhD thesis: ``Measurements and Modelling of CH4 concentrations and carbon-13 in London'', which also forms part of the publication Saboya et al. (2022), ACP, ``Continuous CH4 and d13CH4 measurements in London demonstrate under-reported natural gas leakage''

### Data
A substantial amount of measurement and simulation data are used in this research. Measurement and simulation data are available in Zenodo: Graven, Heather, Zazzeri, Giulia, & Saboya, Eric. (2022). Graven Laboratory: Atmospheric methane measurements and simulations [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6044538 

Additional data (e.g. NAME back-trajectories) can be provided upon request.
